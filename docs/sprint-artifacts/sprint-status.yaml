# Sprint Status File - Generated by BMad Sprint Planning Workflow
# This tracks progress through Implementation phase (Phase 4)

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Epic tech context created by *epic-tech-context (required before story drafting)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review
#   - done: Story completed by *story-done
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done by *retrospective
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epics should be 'contexted' before stories can be 'drafted'
# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - Dev moves story to 'review', SM reviews via *code-review, then Dev moves to 'done' via *story-done
